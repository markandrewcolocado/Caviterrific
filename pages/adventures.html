						<h1>Paragliding <small>Carmona, Cavite</small></h1>
						<p>Location: Sugar Road, Brgy. Lantik, Carmona, 4116 Cavite</p>
						<p>Package inclusive:</p>
						<p>1. •	Tandem Paragliding (10 to 15 minutes flying)</p>
						<p>2. • Use of selfie-pod free-of-charge (personal videography)</p>

						<p><strong>What is tandem paragliding</strong></p>
						<p>Tandem flights are the sweet result of a simple recipe: a wing large enough to hold two people, Paragliding Dual Rated tandem paraglider pilot and a passenger. Each person is seated comfortably in their own harness which are attached together, with the passenger in front and the pilot right behind. The paraglider pilot will take care of the launch, flight and landing for you! Tandem paragliding flights are a great way to enjoy the full paragliding aerial experience, without having to first learn how to launch and control the paraglider yourself. Despite not using an engine, paraglider flight can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, however, we limit our Tandem Flight to 10 to 15 minutes. By skillful exploitation of wind sources of lift at Carmona, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few hundred meters.</p>

Pico de Loro a popular spot to new hikers and to those looking for an adventure.Climbing the rock peak is challenging thrilling and requires a bit of bouldering but is something to be proud of once completed.</p>

						<h1>Corregidor Island <small>Cavite City</small></h1>
						<p>Corregidor is a tadpole shaped island on the mouth of Manila Bay. When the Philippines was yet a colony of Spain, Corregidor served as a fortress; an early warning outpost to warn Manila of any hostile ships; a customs outpost; and a correctional (prison). Because of the corrective effect of hard labor on prisoners, the island was named Corregidor, from the Spanish word "corregir" meaning the corrector. Corregidor is also known as "the rock" because of its rocky landscape and heavy fortifications.</p>
						<p>Corregidor Island is approximately 4 kilometers long, 1.5 kilometers at its widest and a total area of approximately 3 square miles. At the tip of the tail, 2 kilometers south, lies Caballo Island. Both Corregidor and Caballo islands are part of the province of Cavite.</p>
						<p>Today, Corregidor is a historical site and a tourist destination. The island is divided into sections; the "head" is called the "Topside". This is the main part of Corregidor where the headquarters, barracks, war memorial, lighthouse, Eternal Flame, parade grounds, golf course and all the major emplacements are located here. Then there is the "Middleside", where the campsite, aviary, Bird Park and some ruins are located. And the tail end of Corregidor Island is called the "Bottomside". The hotel, administrative building, Gen. MacArthur Park, Gen. Wainwright Park and San Jose Chapel can be found here.</p>
