						<h1>Regada Festival <small>Cavite City</small></h1>
						<p>Regada is a festival in Cavite City in which the merry-making is centered on sprinkling water. It is a week-long celebration starting on the second week of June and ends on the feast day of St. John the Baptist, June 24.</p>
						<p>Regar is a Spanish word meaning ‘to sprinkle’ or ‘to water’. Regada is a combination of ecological, cultural, and spiritual activities participated by Caviteños showing off their unity and camaraderie. In the recent years, Regada kicks-off with Kulay at Tubig, an on-the-spot water color painting contest participated by students from different schools in Cavite City. And then there’s the Regada Trade Fair and the Tahong Fiesta.</p>
						<p>To give back to nature, Caviteños conduct coastal cleaning program as part of the festival. The celebration is at its height on the 24th with the Basayawan sa Kalye as people gather in the stretch of the city streets and party with the Paulan, making it the biggest wet party on the street. The final part of the Regada festival is the Caracol ni San Juan Bautista where the image of the patron saint is set out on a fluvial parade and will be brought to the Paulan to bless the people and in return, to honor St. John the Baptist.</p>

						<h1>Wagayway festival <small>Imus, Cavite</small></h1>
						<p>Wagayway Festival is celebrated every 28th of May in Imus, Cavite to commemorate the Battle of Alapan where many Filipinos following the lead of General Emilio Aguinaldo risked their lives against the conquering Spaniards. Tagged as “wagayway” (wave), the historical Imus is the place when the Philippine Flag was first waved to signify a won battle.</p>
						<p>The said festival is a reminder of the fact that Imus was where the first wave of flag happened. And through this festival, people are reminded of the pride that Imus holds as a significant part of history.</p>
						<p>Then Mayor Emmanuel Maliksi (which is also the current mayor after regaining its position) gave much attention to the fading Imuseno pride and with the hope to regain the former town’s spirit, he initiated the very first Wagayway Festival in 2008. During the event which was filled with many celebrations and awareness campaign of the history of the Battle of Alapan and why Imus should be considered the “Real Flag Capital of the Philippines” (which later on awarded to the city), the most memorable of the celebration was when a re-enactment of the Battle of Alapan was staged for the public. Many spectators during the event were captivated by the dramatic historical milestone and thus ignited the hearts of many Imusenos to regain their pride.</p>

						<h1>Pahimis festival <small>Amadeo, Cavite</small></h1>
						<p>PAHIMIS is the Amadeo word for “pasasalamat” (thanksgiving) in the olden times. As a tradition, coffee farmers gave away his last can of harvest as a sign of thanksgiving, believing that by doing so, luck and abundance would come on the next harvest season. An eat-together gathering with neighbours will serve as the Pahimis before the start of business venture or relatives and friends were sent part or harvest of food as Pahimis.</p>
						<p>To give semblance to the tradition, a coffee festival named after this cultural practice will be held annually for thanksgiving and good luck. The yearly affair seeks to boost the Amadeo’s thriving coffee industry and to position the municipality as one of the promising havens of investment in terms of agri-business and eco-tourism.</p>
						<p>The festival hopes to revive a good tradition of gratefulness for those who do good for themselves and their fellowmen.</p>
